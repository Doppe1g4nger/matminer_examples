Do not worry as binder creates your own isolated environment so you are not really changing any source code. Alternatively, you can clone the [matminer_examples](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer_examples) Github repository to run these notebooks on your machine and also checkout the examples that are written in simple python script which are not shown here.\n",
